[Documentation](https://linktodocumentation)

On this problem I have to find out that how many element are present on the array that is not equal to the given element. I have to find out the number of element and return the value from the removeElement function.

First i have declared a variable k so that i can take counter of the value without given value than i check if the current position of the array is not equal to the given element then i will increase the k value; on the same time we also assign nums[i] value to the nums[k] . so that we can find the expected element later.
